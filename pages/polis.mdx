# Polis

Polis is a [collective intelligence](#) tool which gathers freeform statements from people around a prompt (e.g. "What policies should AI models be trained on?" or "How should ridesharing be regulated in Taiwan?"), and lets them vote Agree, Disagree, or Pass. As votes are received, the survey prioritizes questions so the highest-signal statements are shown first. Statements that are frequently passed are deprioritized.

Voters are clustered into groups, and [principal-component analysis](#) is used to identify statements that both groups agree vs. disagree on. It's also often useful to look at statements that the entire population agreed or disagreed with.

Polis surveys are often referred to as [conversations](#). Even though responders can't reply to each others' statements to avoid escalations of conflict, voters take into account other voices in the room as they write their statements.

## Applications

Polis is commonly used today in government and research settings. It could also be useful for groups with internal disagreements, like open-source and research communities with disagreements, mailing lists, and cooperatives like co-living/co-working spaces (credit: [patcon](https://twitter.com/patcon_), [Max Langenkamp](https://maxlangenkamp.me/)).

## Deployments

- [Metropolis](https://metropolis.vote) is a fork of Polis focused on rewriting the frontend, making it more modular, and implementing improvements for DAOs and Web3 protocols.
- [Viewpoints](https://viewpoints.xyz) is a new Polis-like voting application by [Nathan Young](https://twitter.com/NathanpmYoung).
- [Talk to the City](https://www.talktothe.city/) is a tool for visualizing clusters of textual data that can be used with Polis results, Tweets, and other forms of democratic input.
