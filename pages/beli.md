# Beli

[Beli](https://beliapp.com) is an app for ranking and reviewing restaurants. Many parts of the app are fairly standard, but it introduces a Polis-like (or [AllOurIdeas](https://allourideas.org/)-like) way of ranking restaurants relative to each other:

* When you save/review a restaurant, you're asked to indicate if you thought it was great, OK, or not so good.
* After you've made a selection, the app asks you to stack rank it relative to other restaurants you've given the same rating. You can shuffle it back and forth between other restaurants, or if they're just too similar, you can also select a button that says "This is too tough" to indicate you don't know.
* Using relative rankings, the app generates an implicit rating on a scale of 0.0-10.0 for each restaurant. This is encoded across categories and cuisines, so there's a strong mathematical/collaborative filtering foundation for how this works.

Beli is worth a look at if you're working in this space, if only because it takes a survey process and makes it remarkably user-friendly; it feels like Foursquare or another very natural consumer application.
