## Clustering

The standard Polis algorithm is configured to show the top two clusters generated by PCA. This usually gives predictable, but still meaningful, results:

* A survey of positions on AI clustered participants into those who favored governance of AI and believed in democratic processes, and those who favored acceleration and were skeptical of public-sector safeguards.
* A survey about the San Juan County [Land Bank](https://sjclandbank.org/pol-is-community-discussion/) clustered the population into people who were satisfied with the Land Bank's governance and operations, and those who were opposed or skeptical of it.

When groups are clearly divided, Polis can help surface statements that they nevertheless agree on. For example, the AI survey identified certain statements that had high agreement across both pro-governance and pro-technology camps - e.g. more interpretability research and stronger civil society institutions. These statements are often good material for policy recommendations.

There haven't been any recent explorations of what happens if PCA is configured to generate more than two clusters. For policy applications, the benefits might not be huge, but as an exploratory tool it could be promising to allow users to try different clustering algorithms.
