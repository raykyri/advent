## Experts

Polis makes no distinctions between different participants or voters; everyone votes anonymously and experts' statements are not shown any differently than statements written by someone off the street.

Political scientists and other people who support democratic processes have usually found that having experts and representatives makes participation much more effective - whatever your political leaning, not only is this the foundation of the American democratic system, but more technocrats and progressives also largely believe some version of this view; voters' role is to assess and decide which experts they trust the most.

Polis could be extended to include some concept of experts, where voters review a panel of different experts and their positions, and then are prompted to vote themselves, perhaps on the same questions. [John Brockman's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_Foundation,_Inc.) Edge Magazine hosted an annual event where the editor would ask the same question to a wide variety of influential intellectuals, and their format could be a useful reference for this.
