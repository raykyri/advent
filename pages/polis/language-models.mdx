## Language Models

Polis and AI points to a huge, largely unexplored area of possibilities. For example:

* Right now, Anthropic [works with](https://twitter.com/AnthropicAI/status/1671950647393124352) the Computational Democracy Project to use LLMs to analyze Polis conversations.
* Language models could be used to label the top clusters of Polis respondents. This is a straightforward improvement that would take less than a week to build (as potentially could be done in one day!)
* Language models could be used to create synthetic data and/or synthetic responses. Given two polarized groups and top responses from each of them, a language model could be prompted to produces responses that both sides agree with.
