## Delegation

Polis could be used as a survey for delegates. For example, decentralized organizations often have panels of tens or hundreds of delegates, which can be accessed through voting interfaces like [Agora](https://vote.optimism.io/) and [Tally](https://tally.xyz/). Municipal governments, or even state and national governments, could have their assemblies use a system like Polis.

The Polis algorithm could also be used on existing delegates' or representatives' voting history.

[Metropolis](https://metropolis.vote) is cautiously positioned around this. But the first move is just to collect more data over time in a few pilot communities - later, we can explore how to put together this data to create useful delegation profiles.
